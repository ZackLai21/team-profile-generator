# Team-Profile-Generator

## Description
This is a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person.
I used Jest for running the unit tests and Inquirer for collecting input from the users. The application will be invoked by using the following command:
~~~
node index.js
~~~
